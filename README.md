# ETH
This Solidity contract creates a simple token with a name, abbreviation, and total supply. It keeps track of token balances for each address. The mint function adds tokens to an address and increases the total supply, while the burn function removes tokens from an address, ensuring the balance is sufficient before reducing the total supply and balance.

# HealTheAvatar
Welcome to the world of avatars, while a fight with the enemy, our avatar has got injured and we need to heal it. To heal the avatar we need 10 magic diamonds. To take magic diamonds, we need a pure heart. We don't have a pure heart... Don't worry. There is a special technique of increase the purity and the moment the purity level cross 10, your heart is pured and you are ready to enter the magic temple where the magic diamonds are there. Take 10 magic diamonds from there and heal the Avatar let's see, if you can do it. 

This solidity project appli the concept of error handling. In this we have used four functions defined as follows:

increasePurity
EnterTheMagicTemple
takeTheMagicDiamond
healTheAvatar

We have three variables : 
    uint public devotionLevel;
    bool public purity = false;
    uint public magicDiamond ;
