# ETH
This Solidity contract creates a simple token with a name, abbreviation, and total supply. It keeps track of token balances for each address. The mint function adds tokens to an address and increases the total supply, while the burn function removes tokens from an address, ensuring the balance is sufficient before reducing the total supply and balance.
